                           <li> In the past, a career in programming or coding generally required a college degree. But that is no longer the case. With the growth of online learning, it is now possible to learn to code without going to college.</li>
                           <li>There are plenty of free resources available online that can teach you everything you need to know about coding. And many companies are now hiring coders without a college degree. So if you’re looking to get into coding without incurring the cost of college education, it is definitely possible.</li>

                    <li>
                        YouTube has often been described as a free "university". A lot of people have become software engineers, web developers, data analysts, database engineers, and administrators by watching YouTube videos and putting what they learn into practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        freeCodeCamp has a YouTube channel with over 1,000 videos on web development, data science, machine learning, freelancing, databases, and everything related to tech.
                    </li>
                    <Li>
                        In addition to the freeCodeCamp channel, there are lots of other great channels such as Traversy Media, NetNinja, WebDevSimplified, Florin Pop, AmigosCode,Apna collage and a lot more.

                </ul>
                <li><h2>Learn to Code with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"target="_main">MDN</a> (Mozilla Developer Network)</h2></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>MDN has one of the largest collections of documentation for web technologies and APIs such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>If you are the type that likes to learn by reading, MDN is a great place to learn coding and web development.</li>
                    <li>The beautiful thing about MDN is that the documentation is regularly updated and so you learn everything in a modern way.</li>
                </ul>
                <Li><h2>Learning a Language</h2></Li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        
Don't worry too much about what language you pick. Many beginning coders struggle with what language to pick when they first start learning. (Because they don't know where to start with their first code). The actual language that you start learning on doesn't make a big difference when it comes to learning about data structures and logic. These are the skills that matter most, and they can be honed with any language
                    </li>
                    <li>When picking a language, just focus on what kind of development you want to start with and pick an introductory language from there. For example, if you want to learn web development, start with HTML5, supplemented with CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. If you want to want to do desktop applications, start with C++ or another basic programming language.</li>
                    <Li>If you make coding a career, you will find that you may never use the language that you first learned to code. Instead, you will be learning languages as you go through documentation and experimentation.</Li>

                </ul>
<li><h2>Expanding Your Knowledge</h2></li>
<ul>
    <li>
        Take classes. Community colleges, tech schools and online programs offer certifications and classes that will help you get a job as well as teaching you programming. An advanced degree like Computer Science is not always necessary, but could help to get a full time programming job.
    </li>
    <li>
        Classes can get expensive, so weigh the benefits. If programming is just a hobby, classes may not be worth the time and money. If you want to turn programming into a career, classes can give you a big boost (but again, it's far from necessary if you have the talent)
    </li>
    <li>(A lot can be said for having one-on-one time with a teacher or programming expert, something that isn't always available with online sources).</li>
</ul>
<Li><h2>Learn more languages.</h2></Li>
<ul>
    <li>Java is one of the most popular languages, and there are often lots of opportunities for Java developers. Java can run on a huge variety of systems and has innumerable applications. Java is used for Android applications, one of the fastest growing markets.</li>
    <li>
        C++ is highly recommended for developing video games. Learning how to code in Unity (a widely used, low-cost game engine) and UDK (the code for the popular Unreal engine) can help open some doors, though they aren't as useful outside of the video game industry.
    </li>
    <li>If you want to make iPhone apps, Xcode and Objective-C are going to be your primary tools. You'll also need a Mac, since Xcode can only compile on a Mac</li>
    <li>Python is a server scripting language that is one of the easier languages to learn. Python is used for web services such as Pinterest and Instagram, and is simple enough to learn the basics in just a few days.
    </li>
